Our first course of action was to research what goals Scholastic would seek to accomplish through this program. We found that Scholastic's reputation as an educational resource was in decline among students and teachers. The question then became, how can we build an application that regains Scholastic's reputation and increase children's interest in reading? Our solution was to create a reading incentive product that is engaging and educational for children. We believe this would :</p><ul><li>Solve parents' need to encourage children to read</li><li>Prove commitment to education</li><li>Foster excitement for Scholastic titles</li></ul></div></div></section><section><div class="flex"><div class="container-sml"><h3>Challenge</h3><p>We were tasked with creating a reading engagement product for Scholastic.</p><div><h3>Duration</h3><p>2 Weeks</p></div><div><h3>Client</h3><p></p>Scholastic was the assigned client for the student project during the User Experience Design Immersive at General Assembly, San Francisco 2014 </div><div><h3>My Role</h3><p>User research, persona development, feature development, scope definition, project management, sketching and ideation, branding, presentation deck</p></div></div></div></section><section><h2 class="section-title center">Business Research</h2><div class="flex"><div class="container-sml"><img alt="Competitive Analysis Diagram" src="img/schol/comp_analysis_chart.png"><h3>Reading program competitive landscape</h3><ul><li>Few reading incentive programs combine assessments,  web portal and prizes/ parent added prizes.</li><li>Assessments, if any, are in a traditional test format and focus on remembering trivia from the book
